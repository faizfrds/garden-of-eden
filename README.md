# Motivation
As the global population continues to surge and the climate becomes increasingly unstable, agriculture is being put under immense pressure to meet growing food demands. Currently, traditional agricultural practices make up a majority of the agriculture industry worldwisde. However, it is unsuitable for meeting the rising global demands for food security and environmental sustainability; the intensive manual labor and the reliance on traditional knowledge produce ineffective crop yields and often wastes natural resources, posing a significant threat to food security and sustainability. As a result, it is reasonable to redirect our attention to automated, data-driven technological solutions that are capable of addressing these concerns. 

# Smart Farming
Agriculture 4.0, also known as smart farming, aims to address these issues. Smart farming has become increasingly popular in recent times as it offers a pathway to reduce manual labor and provide data-driven insights into agriculture, offering more productive yields and effective resource management. It uses various tools such as temperature sensors, robots, and GPS technologies to revolutionize agriculture. The promising outlook of smart farming hopes to mitigate the risk of food security and environmental degradation globally. 

## Description

This small project aims to demonstrate smart farming at a much smaller and accessible scale. It uses a NodeMCU microcontroller that is equipped with temperature, humidity, and soil moisture sensors working together to automate irrigation. The goal of this project is to educate others on the compelling benefits that technology can have on nature.
